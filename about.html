            <h3>As a barrel child, born in Kingston, Jamaica, I left in 1981 to join my mother in England at age thirteen. I am the eldest child of six siblings.</h3>
            
            <p class="synopsis-m synopsis-s about-d">I attended Tivoli Gardens High School in Jamaica and lived in Kingston 11. I attended Brondesbury and Kilburn High School in London and later graduated with an honours degree in Finance and Accounting at the Thames Valley University (Ealing Campus).<br><br>I am a mother of four children, the youngest in his final year at high school.<br><br>There were challenges to face in a new country of residence and the journey had many ups and downs. However, my own story is different as I saw my mother leave to make life better for her girls and as promised, though after five years which seemed like a lifetime (for a child), she kept her promise. Life is not easy but where failure is not an option you will make it. I can only continue to aspire to my purpose and pray at the end I will have accomplished all my goals. <br/><br><a href="interviews.html" class="button btn-m"> Interviews</a><br><br></p>
